### Hi there 👋

I'm Sezer İltekin 👋🏼
Native iOS Developer 👨🏻‍💻 from Istanbul, Türkiye 🇹🇷

I love to learn, code and produce creative content 💡 This has been my lifestyle since childhood and I will continue to learn and improve myself 🧠 throughout my life.

I've been developed websites and web applications using PHP 🐘 since 2016. You can see a small part of my work on my [portfolio page](https://iltekin.com/portfolio/). Along with PHP, of course, I also use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in my projects. In 2021, I decided to switch from Web to Mobile development and nowadays I am writing my codes in Swift language to be an iOS Developer 👨🏻‍💻
